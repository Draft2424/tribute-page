           <h2>Doing deals doesn't yield the deep rewards that come from building up people.</h2> 
            <p> As the students discuss the answers to these questions, I open my own life to them as a case study of
                sorts, to illustrate how they can use the theories from our course to guide their life decisions.</p><p> One of the theories that gives great insight on the first question—how to be sure we find happiness in
                our careers—is from Frederick Herzberg, who asserts that the powerful motivator in our lives isn't
                money; it's the opportunity to learn, grow in responsibilities, contribute to others, and be recognized
                for achievements. I tell the students about a vision of sorts I had while I was running the company I
                founded before becoming an academic. In my mind's eye I saw one of my managers leave for work one
                morning with a relatively strong level of self-esteem. Then I pictured her driving home to her family 10
                hours later, feeling unappreciated, frustrated, underutilized, and demeaned. I imagined how profoundly
                her lowered self-esteem affected the way she interacted with her children. The vision in my mind then
                fast-forwarded to another day, when she drove home with greater self-esteem—feeling that she had learned
                a lot, been recognized for achieving valuable things, and played a significant role in the success of
                some important initiatives. I then imagined how positively that affected her as a spouse and a parent.
                My conclusion: Management is the most noble of professions if it's practiced well. No other occupation
                offers as many ways to help others learn and grow, take responsibility and be recognized for
                achievement, and contribute to the success of a team. More and more MBA students come to school thinking
                that a career in business means buying, selling, and investing in companies. That's unfortunate. Doing
                deals doesn't yield the deep rewards that come from building up people.
            </p> <p>I want students to leave my classroom knowing that. </p>
